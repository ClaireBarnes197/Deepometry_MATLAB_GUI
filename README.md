# Deepometry (MATLAB version)
Deep learning-based image classification and featurization for imaging (flow) cytometry.

This workflow was originally built for imaging flow cytometry data but can be readily adapted for any microscopic images of isolated single objects. The modified implementation of ResNet50 allows researchers to use data made up of any number of color channels.

# Installation

The MATLAB version of Deepometry requires the following toolboxes:

        1. Statistical toobox
        2. Deep learning toolbox
    
Deepometry also makes use of the MATLAB version of [bioformats,] www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/ a standalone Java library for reading and writing life science image file formats.(Please note that the minimum MATLAB version recommended for this package is R2017b). Lastly, this version completes some basic plots of features learnt from data by applying several dimensional reduction techniques, in particular, UMAP. A MATLAB version can be downloaded from [File Exchange] www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71902-uniform-manifold-approximation-and-projection-umap.
